# IMPORTANT!!!

Before this plugin or menu item will work correctly with e107 you will need to rename the directory you're presented with to `newsmailer`.
If you are not comfortable with doing this you will need to wait until I push a release to [plugins.e107](http://plugins.e107.org/).

# News Mailer

Allows you to send an email to a selected userclass with an entire months or a select days news items.
